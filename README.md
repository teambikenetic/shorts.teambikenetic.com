Parameters:

- Public podcast, promoted as team content
- Aim to publish every wed or thurs, idea being mid-week so results from weekend before are out and people are vectoring towards upcoming weekend events
- Minimize cursing to keep pg-rated
- 1-2 minutes, no more than 2 minutes

General agenda:

- Races last weekend, notable results
- Quick on the spot interview - review of a good clip or event or action or pro move or whatever
- or, other podcasts or videos or grams or content to check out ?
- Any mentions on sister teams (Gnarlington Shreddlers, etc.)
- Upcoming stuff, schedule your stuff, highlight local races we are participating in, any inside details or tips if we have them
- Team business
- Where to find us, if you have something for next week get it to us by next mon

Example script:

For this week, we could quickly summarize that we had racers at RPI,
SM100, and Roanoke SM100 (three disciplines!), note a few results, Schultz
on his way to cat 2, etc. Mid-week racing featured two people in bikenetic
kits racing in Portland, one who has never raced CX before! Quick 15-30 s
interview with Spinks about the Kerry "incident". Note that Gnarlington
Shreddlers (NICA sister MTB team in Virginia) has their first race of
the season this weekend, good luck!  Don't forget Luray and Hub Labels
CX races this weekend, we have folks in both, registration closes for
Hub tonight and Luray tomorrow! Find us on instagram at @teambikenetic

Other content as needed:

- interesting/travel beer report, e.g. hawk found x in city y this week
- tech corner, e.g. new warbird hit the shop this week
- call out interesting rides observed in strava group, i.e. shue or vin or pete or whomever did something insane

Schedule:

- Aim to try this out until end of cx nats (mid dec 2018); reevaulate.
- Tues, prep draft script and send questions and negotiate timing for any requested interviewer (pro perspective from Spinks or Tyson or whomever as things evolve), They have time to research and have informed opinion on whatever they want to talk about
- Wed or Thurs, edit & publish to itunes/overcast/stitcher/whatever
- Rotate hosts as much as possible, if doable. Have to experiment a bit on audio levels and recording and such. 2 minute max podcasts should make this not super painful.

Goals:

- Team branding strength
- Lay-up for shop related sales opportunities or skills (so and so raced their sick new wheels)
- Lend a bit more personality to the team. We're big. FB is noisy and confusing. This might be interesting.
